# Project 1 - Network Science

# Choose one dataset, and analyze it by developing your own network code in your favorite language, implementing some of the metrics discussed in the course
# You may also use one of the network libraries available

# What to compute? - Characterize the average degree and degree distribution of the network.
                #  - Clustering coefficient and average path length.
                #  - Infer the importance (centrality) of each node (choose one relevant centrality measure for the chosen dataset and justify your choice).
                #  - Suggest a set of principles responsible for the self-organization and creation of such network topology/topologies.

# NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.
